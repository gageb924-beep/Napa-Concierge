# Cold Email Templates for Napa Concierge

## Email 1: Hotels (Primary Template)

**Subject lines (A/B test these):**
- Your guests are asking the same questions every day
- Quick question about {{company_name}} guest services
- Idea for {{company_name}} - 2 min read

---

Hi,

I noticed {{company_name}} gets great reviews for guest experience.

Quick question: how much time does your front desk spend answering "where should we eat?" and "which wineries should we visit?"

I built an AI concierge specifically for Napa Valley hotels. It knows every winery, restaurant, and hidden gem in the valley - and answers guests 24/7 via a chat widget on your site.

Here's a 30-second demo: [YOUR_DEMO_URL]

A few hotels are already using it to:
- Free up front desk staff for higher-value tasks
- Capture guest emails before they even check in
- Provide consistent, knowledgeable recommendations at 2am

Would a quick 10-minute call be useful? I can show you exactly how it would look on {{company_name}}'s website.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - The widget matches your brand colors and can include your specific partnerships (if you have preferred restaurants or wineries you recommend).

## Email 2: Wineries (Primary Template)

**Subject lines:**
- Idea for {{company_name}} tasting room
- Your visitors before they arrive
- Quick thought on {{company_name}} guest experience

---

Hi,

I saw {{company_name}} offers incredible tasting experiences.

Here's a thought: what if visitors could get personalized recommendations *before* they arrive? Things like what to eat nearby, what other wineries to visit, or how to plan their day around their {{company_name}} appointment.

I built an AI concierge for Napa Valley that does exactly this. It lives on your website and helps visitors:
- Plan their day around their tasting appointment
- Get dining recommendations that pair with your wines
- Answer questions 24/7 (even when you're pouring)

Quick demo: [YOUR_DEMO_URL]

It also captures visitor emails and interests - so you know who's coming and what they care about before they walk through your doors.

Worth a 10-minute look?

Best,
[Your name]

## Email 4: Breakup email (7 days after follow-up)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

---

Hi,

I've reached out a couple times about the AI concierge - totally understand if it's not a fit right now.

If you're interested in exploring this later, just reply "later" and I'll check back in a few months.

Either way, no hard feelings. Cheers to a great season in wine country.

## Tips for Better Response Rates

1. **Personalize the first line** - mention something specific about their property (a recent review, their architecture, an award they won)

2. **Send Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am Pacific** - best open rates for hospitality

3. **Keep it under 150 words** - busy people skim

4. **One clear CTA** - either watch the demo OR book a call, not both

5. **Use their name if you can find it** - "Hi Sarah" beats "Hi"

## Finding Decision Maker Names

- Check LinkedIn for "General Manager" or "Director of Operations" at the property
- Look at their website's About/Team page
- Call and ask: "Who handles technology decisions for guest services?"

## Sequence Timing

- Day 1: Send Email 1 (Hotel) or Email 2 (Winery)
- Day 4: Send Email 3 (Follow-up)
- Day 11: Send Email 4 (Breakup)

Keep it to 3 emails max. More than that feels spammy.
